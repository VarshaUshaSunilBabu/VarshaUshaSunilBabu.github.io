    <h1>Hi, I'm Varsha Usha Sunil Babu</h1>
    <p>ðŸš€ <strong>Data Scientist | Risk Analyst | AI Enthusiast</strong></p>
    <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio! I am a Data Science & AI professional with a passion for 
        using technology and data-driven insights to solve real-world problems.
        My work focuses on financial risk analysis, predictive modeling, and AI-driven 
        decision-making. With experience in machine learning, statistical analysis, and 
        data visualization, I strive to turn raw data into meaningful insights.
    </p>

    <h2>ðŸ“Œ My Projects</h2>
    <p>Here are some of my key projects that highlight my expertise in data science and risk analysis:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>ðŸ”® Credit Risk Prediction:</strong>
            <p>A machine learning model that estimates the probability of loan default. This project 
            involves feature engineering, probability of default (PD) calculations, and expected loss estimation.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>ðŸš† UK Rail Delay Prediction:</strong>
            <p>Developed a predictive model using real-time weather data, train schedules, and 
            historical delays to forecast train disruptions. This project applies regression models 
            and time-series forecasting techniques.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>ðŸ“ˆ Market Risk Stress Testing:</strong>
            <p>Created a financial risk analysis framework to assess market volatility under 
            different stress scenarios. The project uses Value at Risk (VaR), Monte Carlo simulations, 
            and economic stress testing models.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>ðŸ’¡ About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I have a strong academic background in Data Science & AI, combined with hands-on experience 
        in financial analytics, machine learning, and predictive modeling. My expertise lies in
        analyzing complex datasets, identifying patterns, and implementing AI-driven solutions to 
        enhance decision-making processes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond my professional work, I am a self-taught digital artist and enjoy creating 
        illustrations in my free time. I am also fascinated by the intersection of AI and 
        finance, particularly in risk management, fraud detection, and algorithmic trading.
    </p>
